# React Native App for Searching Images

### Introduction
Hello, My name is Damon Ye and this is a React Native App I built! It uses the pixabay api to retrieve images. It displays a list of images based on your search query. Each image can be clicked to bring you to a page that has more details about the image. Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

### Installation
**Fork** and **clone** this repository.

Then insall the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then create a `.secrets.env.js` file. Export a `const` named `PIXABAY_API_KEY` storing your pixabay api key.

Then start the app and run the iOS simulator

```
npm run ios
```
